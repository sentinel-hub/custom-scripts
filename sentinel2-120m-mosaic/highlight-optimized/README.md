## General description

This script uses highlight optimization to avoid burnt out pixels and to even out the exposure. It is most useful for visualizing clouds and snow, as they look natural and retain as much visual information as possible. The script applies the square root of the Sentinel-2 true color bands, which have lowered brightness and increased contrast. In Sentinel-2 L2A 120 m Mosaic, Sentinel-2 bands are divided by 3000 to bring them to an expected range 0-1. 

```javascript
//VERSION=3
let factor = 1/3000
return [Math.cbrt(0.6*B04*factor - 0.035),
        Math.cbrt(0.6*B03*factor - 0.035),
        Math.cbrt(0.6*B02*factor - 0.035), 
        dataMask]
```
The script was originally written for Sentinel-2, and was modified for the Sentinel-2 L2A 120 m Mosaic collection. See the original script with more information [here](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-3/true_color_highlight_optimized/).
