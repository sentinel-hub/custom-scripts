## General description

A true color composite uses visible light bands red, green and blue in the corresponding red, green and blue color channels, resulting in a natural colored product, that is a good representation of the Earth as humans would see it naturally. For Sentinel-2 L2A 120 m Mosaic, the bands (B04, B03, B02) are divided by 3000 to bring them to an expected range of 0-1.
