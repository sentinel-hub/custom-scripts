## General description of the script  
This script visualises seasonal trajectories PPI . The Seasonal Trajectories PPI is derived through fitting a smoothing and gap filling function to the yearly time-series raw PPI values. The color map is adopted from https://github.com/jacobs-tim/copernicus-land-monitoring-service-hrvpp-colourmaps
