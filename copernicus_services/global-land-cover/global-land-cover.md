# Global Land Cover

Global Land Cover products at 100 m resolution are delivered annually by [ The Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS)](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc). The most recent collection 3 (version 3.0.1) of 100 m Land Cover products for the years 2015 - 2019 were generated from the PROBA-V 100 m and 300 m satellite observations and several other ancillary datasets, with global coverage. Global Land Cover products are generated from 3 years input data in three modes: base reference, consolidated or near real time mode.  As from 2020, (2019-conso and 2020-nrt products) are planned to be generated from the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite observations following end of PROBA-V operations. The  Global Land Cover data contains one main _land cover discrete classification map_ and several other additional layers. For more information on Global land cover products, see the [product User Manual](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/sites/cgls.vito.be/files/products/CGLOPS1_PUM_LC100m-V3_I3.4.pdf).
