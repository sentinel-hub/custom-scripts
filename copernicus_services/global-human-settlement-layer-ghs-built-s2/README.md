## General description of the script

The Global Human Settlement Layer *GHS-BUILT-S2* is a global map of built-up areas (expressed as probabilities from 0 to 100 %) at 10 m spatial resolution. It was derived from a Sentinel-2 global image composite for the reference year 2018 using Convolutional Neural Networks.

This script visualises the built-up probabilities stretched to 0-255.
