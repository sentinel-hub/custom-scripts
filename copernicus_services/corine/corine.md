# CORINE Land Cover 

In 1985 the 'Coordination of Information on the Environment' (CORINE) programme was initiated by the European Commission. It aimed at collecting environmental information on high priority topics for the European Union (air, water, soil, land cover, coastal erosion, biotopes, etc.). Since 1994, the established databases and programmes are managed by the [European Environment Agency (EEA)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/). The [CORINE Land Cover (CLC) inventory](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover) is a vector-based dataset that consists of 44 land cover and land use classes. There are altogether 5 mapping inventories implemented since 1986, producing five status layers (CLC1990, CLC2000, CLC2006, CLC2012, CLC2018), 4 CLC-Change (CLCC) layers for the corresponding periods (1990-2000, 2000-2006, 2006-2012, 2012-2018) and 4 CLC Accounting  Layers for 2000, 2006, 201, 2018.  
[CLC Accounting Layers](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-accounting-layers) are CLC status layers modified for the purpose of consistent statistical analysis in the land cover change accounting system at EEA.  
CORINE Land Cover data is available in Sentinel Hub, read more in our [Public Collections](https://collections.sentinel-hub.com/tag/corine/).
