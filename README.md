## <a name="sentinel-1"></a>Sentinel-1
The Sentinel-1 imagery is provided by two polar-orbiting satellites, operating day and night performing C-band synthetic aperture radar imaging, enabling them to acquire imagery regardless of the weather. Main applications are for monitoring sea ice, oil spills, marine winds, waves & currents, land-use change, land deformation among others, and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes. The identical satellites orbit Earth 180° apart and at an altitude of almost 700 km, offering a global revisit time of 6-12 days depending on the area (check observation scenario). Sentinel-1’s radar can operate in four modes. The spatial resolution depends on the mode: approx. 5 m x 20 m for IW mode and approx. 20 m x 40 m for EW mode. See [Copernicus services](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/) for more details.

## <a name="sentinel-2"></a>Sentinel-2
Dedicated to supplying data for [Copernicus services](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2), Sentinel-2 carries a multispectral imager with a swath of 290 km. The imager provides a versatile set of 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and near infrared to the shortwave infrared, featuring four spectral bands at 10 m, six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60 m spatial resolution. As indices primarily deal with combining various band reflectances, the table of 13 bands is given here for reference (see [here](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/msi-instrument){:target="_blank"} for details). The names of the Sentinel-2 bands at your disposal are *B01*, *B02*, *B03*, *B04*, *B05*, *B06*, *B07*, *B08*, *B8A*, *B09*, *B10*, *B11* and  *B12*.

Landsat 7 and the retired Landsat 5 orbit's are sun-synchronous, with near-polar orbits, flying at an altitude of 705 km (438 mi). Landsat 5 long outlived its original three-year design life. Developed by NASA and launched in 1984, Landsat 5 has orbited the planet over 150,000 times while transmitting over 2.5 million images land surface images around the world. The Landsat 7 satellite still orbits the the Earth in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit, at an altitude of 705 km (438 mi). The satellites are multispectra, providing visible, near infrared, mid infrared and thermal bands.

## <a name="dem"></a>DEM

DEM (digital elevation model) is a 3D representation of the terrain's surface created from terrain elevation data. It can be used for terrain analysis and orthorectification, which helps improve the accuracy of satellite imagery. With DEM, you are able to measure and analyze your area of interest or integrate data into a 3D application as a terrain data source. Sentinel Hub is using MapZen's DEM, available through Amazon Web Services (AWS) in US. This dataset is based on SRTM30 (30 m resolution) but is in several places improved with local datasets. It is static and does not depend on the date (the values are updating as MapZen is improving the dataset). Read the blog post on [how to explore the DEM dataset](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/digital-elevation-model-dem-3c05141bb03d) and [see our API documentation for details](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/dem/).

## <a name="data-fusion"></a>Data fusion

The combination of multiple remote sensing data sources can provide invaluable information that would not be obtained with a single sensor alone. Observation-level or pixel-based fusion combines pixels from different sources to form an image containing new information ([more information](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7740215)). Two widely used examples of pixel-based fusion are pan-sharpening and the fusion of radar and multispectral optical images. On the one hand, pan-sharpening consists of blending a high-resolution panchromatic image with a lower resolution multispectral image to obtain a high-resolution multispectral image. On the other hand, the combination of radar and optical imagery provides images with increased spectral resolution that can mitigate the drawbacks of each product (such as cloud cover for optical images), but also provide increased temporal resolution with more frequent overpasses.

### CORINE Land Cover  

In 1985 the 'Coordination of Information on the Environment' (CORINE) programme was initiated by the European Commission. It aimed at collecting environmental information on high priority topics for the European Union (air, water, soil, land cover, coastal erosion, biotopes, etc.). Since 1994, the established databases and programmes are managed by the [European Environment Agency (EEA)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/). The [CORINE Land Cover (CLC) inventory](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover) is a vector-based dataset that consists of 44 land cover and land use classes. There are altogether 5 mapping inventories implemented since 1986, producing five status layers (CLC1990, CLC2000, CLC2006, CLC2012, CLC2018), 4 CLC-Change (CLCC) layers for the corresponding periods (1990-2000, 2000-2006, 2006-2012, 2012-2018) and 4 CLC Accounting  Layers for 2000, 2006, 201, 2018.  
[CLC Accounting Layers](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-accounting-layers) are CLC status layers modified for the purpose of consistent statistical analysis in the land cover change accounting system at EEA.  
CORINE Land Cover data is available in Sentinel Hub, read more in our [Public Collections](https://collections.sentinel-hub.com/tag/corine/).

### WorldCover
  [WorldCover](https://esa-worldcover.org/en) is a global land cover map produced at 10m resolution based on combination of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. 
  In areas where Sentinel-2 images are covered by clouds for an extended period of time, Sentinel-1 data then provides complimentary information on the structural 
  characteristics of the observed land cover. Therefore, the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data makes it possible to update the land cover map almost in real time. 
  WorldCover has been produced for 2020 with a global coverage. It provides valuable information for applications such as biodiversity, food security, carbon assessment and climate modelling.  
  WorldCover data is available in Sentinel Hub, read more in our [Public Collections](https://collections.sentinel-hub.com/tag/worldcover/).

## <a name="sentinel2-120m-mosaic"></a>Sentinel-2 L2A 120m Mosaic

Sentinel-2 L2A 120m mosaic is a derived product, offering a cloudless mosaic of the whole world for all 12 Sentinel-2 bands. It is thus possible to create Sentinel-2 visualizations on a global level. The resolution of the collection is 120 meters. The product contains best pixel values for 10-daily periods, modelled by removing the cloudy pixels and then performing interpolation among remaining values. As clouds can be missed and as there are some parts of the world which have lengthy cloudy periods, clouds might be remaining in some parts. The collection is available for 2019 (with 6 Sentinel-2 bands) and annually since 2020 (all 12 Sentinel-2 bands). The modelling script is available [here](https://sentinel-hub.github.io/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/interpolated_time_series/).
