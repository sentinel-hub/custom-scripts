# Soil Water Content

Soil Water Content (SWC) measures the amount of water in a unit volume of soil, which is crucial information for drought monitoring, water management, and climate risk assessment.

Planet's SWC product provides near-daily measurements at spatial resolutions of 100 m and 1000 m. It is unhindered by clouds and has a long and consistent data record of more than 20 years. Please check [here](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/planetary-variables/soil-water-content/#available-bands) for a list of available bands. Soil Water Content is measured in $$m^3/m^3$$.
