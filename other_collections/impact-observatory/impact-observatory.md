# 10m Annual Land Use Land Cover (9-class)
  The [10m Annual Land Use Land Cover (LULC)](https://www.impactobservatory.com/maps-for-good/) map is collaboratively produced by Impact Observatory, Microsoft, and Esri.
  The data collection is available globally and derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution, using Impact Ovservatory's state of the art deep learning AI land classification model which is trained by billions of human-labeled image pixels.
  There are 9 LULC classes generated by the algorithm, including Built, Crops, Trees, Water, Rangeland, Flooded Vegetation, Snow/Ice, Bare Ground, and Clouds.
