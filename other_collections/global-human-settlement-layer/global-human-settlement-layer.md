# Global Human Settlement Layer

The Global Human Settlement (GHS) framework produces global maps of built-up, population density and settlements to monitor human presence on Earth over time. The data are managed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the DG for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO) of the European Commission, together with the international partnership GEO Human Planet Initiative of the GEO Human Planet Initiative.
