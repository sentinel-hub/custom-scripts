# PlanetScope (Commercial)

<a href="https://www.planet.com/products/monitoring/">PlanetScope</a> satellite constellation consists of more than 130 small satellites called Doves. The satellites are launched in groups, which constantly improves mission's characteristics such as revisit times, spatial and spectral resolutions. PlanetScope data complements Sentinel-2 with better spatial resolution (3m) and almost global daily coverage. It is an excellent source for vegetation monitoring.
